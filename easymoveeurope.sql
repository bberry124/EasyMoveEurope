However, it doesn&#39;t have to be that way! Hiring a van with a driver can make your house<br />\r\nremoval experience smooth, efficient, and hassle-free. In this blog, we&#39;ll explore the top reasons why you<br />\r\nshould consider hiring a van with a driver for your upcoming house removal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>1. Expertise and Experience</strong><br />\r\nA van with a driver brings invaluable expertise and experience to your house removal. Professional<br />\r\ndrivers are well-versed in navigating various routes, handling different types of belongings, and ensuring<br />\r\nthe safe transportation of your items. Their familiarity with traffic patterns and road conditions means<br />\r\nthey can find the most efficient and secure route to your new home, saving you time and unnecessary<br />\r\nstress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>2. Stress-Free Packing and Loading</strong><br />\r\nPacking and loading your belongings is often the most daunting aspect of house removal. However, with<br />\r\na van and driver, you can breathe a sigh of relief. They will assist you in safely and systematically<br />\r\nloading your items into the van, making sure that everything is securely fastened to prevent shifting<br />\r\nduring transit. Moreover, they come equipped with the necessary tools and equipment to handle even the<br />\r\nmost challenging items, such as heavy furniture or delicate antiques.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>3. Cost-Effective Solution</strong><br />\r\nHiring a van with a driver can be a cost-effective option compared to other house removal services. With<br />\r\ntraditional moving companies, you may have to pay for full-service packages that include packing,<br />\r\nloading, and transporting. With a van and driver, you have more control over the process, and you can<br />\r\nchoose to handle the packing yourself, reducing overall costs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>4. Flexibility and Convenience</strong><br />\r\nOne of the most significant advantages of hiring a van with a driver is the flexibility and convenience it<br />\r\noffers. You can customize the schedule according to your preferences, ensuring that your house removal<br />\r\nfits your busy agenda. Whether you need a weekend move or an evening relocation, a van with a driver<br />\r\ncan accommodate your timing needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>5. Personalized Service</strong><br />\r\nWhen you hire a van with a driver, you receive personalized attention and care for your belongings.<br />\r\nUnlike large moving companies, a van and driver cater exclusively to your house removal, giving you</p>\r\n\r\n<p>peace of mind that your items are handled with utmost care and attention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n6. Local Knowledge<br />\r\nIf you&#39;re moving within the same city or region, a driver with local knowledge can be a significant<br />\r\nadvantage. They are familiar with the area, shortcuts, and potential traffic hotspots, ensuring a smoother<br />\r\nand quicker relocation process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nConclusion<br />\r\n<a href=\"http://easymoveeurope.com\">Hiring a van</a> with a driver for your house removal can transform a potentially stressful experience into an<br />\r\nenjoyable and efficient journey. With their expertise, stress-free packing and loading, cost-effectiveness,<br />\r\nflexibility, personalized service, and local knowledge, you can rest assured that your belongings are in<br />\r\nsafe hands. Embrace the convenience and peace of mind that a van with a driver offers, and make your<br />\r\nhouse removal a memorable and positive experience.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><a class=\"bbtn\" href=\"https://easymoveeurope.com/\">Get a Free quote now!</a></p>', '1', 'Moving to a new house is an exciting journey, but the process of house removal can be overwhelming and stressful.', 'hire a van with driver, house removals, removal companies, removal company, furniture removal, Local movers, man and van service', '2023-07-29 13:26:35', '2023-08-07 17:10:10'),

If you&#39;re looking to move your piano without spending a fortune on professional<br />\r\nmovers, follow these steps to ensure a safe and smooth relocation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1. Hire a Dedicated Van with a Tail-Lift:</strong><br />\r\nTo move your piano safely and efficiently, consider renting a dedicated van with a tail lift. This<br />\r\ntype of van will require fewer people to handle the move and provide a secure and fast<br />\r\ntransportation option for your valuable instrument.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2. Prepare the Piano for Transport:</strong><br />\r\nBefore loading the piano into the van, take the necessary precautions to protect it during the<br />\r\nmove. Use moving blankets or thick towels to cover the piano and secure them in place with<br />\r\nmultiple rolls of tape. For an upright piano, ensure you have a dolly capable of holding its<br />\r\nweight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3. Measure Doorways, Staircases, and Hallways:</strong><br />\r\nTo avoid any difficulties during the move, measure all doorways, staircases, and hallways that<br />\r\nthe piano will pass through in both your current and new locations. This step will help you plan<br />\r\nthe best route for maneuvering the piano and piano board through your home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4. Clear the Pathway:</strong><br />\r\nBefore moving the piano, make sure all pathways are clear of obstacles and furniture that could<br />\r\npotentially damage the instrument. Cover sharp edges of doorways with baby-proof bumpers or<br />\r\nextra towels to prevent scratches or nicks during the move.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>5. Enlist Helpers:</strong><br />\r\nWhile the van&#39;s driver can assist with the move, having some friends, family members, or<br />\r\nneighbors available to help, especially for heavier pianos, can make the process smoother and<br />\r\nsafer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>6. Secure the Piano in the Van:</strong><br />\r\nOnce the piano is properly packed and ready for transport, use ratchet straps to secure it firmly<br />\r\ninside the van. This will prevent any shifting or potential damage during transit. When you <a href=\"https://easymoveeurope.com\"><span style=\"color:#000000\">hire a<br />\r\nvan</span></a> with us, the driver will do this for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>7. Unloading the Piano:</strong><br />\r\nWhen unloading the piano from the van, ensure at least one person is in front of the piano for<br />\r\nbetter control and guidance. Depending on the piano&#39;s weight, you may need more people to<br />\r\nassist with the safe unloading process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>After the Move:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1. Reassemble the Piano:</strong><br />\r\nIf you own a grand piano, seek help from family and friends to reassemble it after the move.<br />\r\nSteady the piano while reattaching the legs and setting it back upright.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2. Clean the Exterior:</strong><br />\r\nAfter the move, wipe the piano with a soft, clean cloth or feather duster to remove any<br />\r\naccumulated dust. Avoid cleaning the piano&#39;s interior yourself; instead, hire a professional piano<br />\r\ncleaning service for this delicate task.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3. Piano Tuning:</strong><br />\r\nDue to environmental changes during the move, your piano may need tuning. Call in a<br />\r\nprofessional piano tuner to ensure your piano is in optimal condition and producing the best<br />\r\nsound.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://easymoveeurope.com\"><span style=\"color:#000000\">Moving a piano</span></a> without professional movers can be successful with the right preparation,<br />\r\nequipment, and assistance from family and friends. By following these steps, you can safely<br />\r\nrelocate your piano and ensure it remains in top condition for years to come.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<a class=\"bbtn\" href=\"https://easymoveeurope.com/\">Get a Free quote now!</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', '1', 'Moving a piano can be a challenging task, but with the right approach and tools, it can become much easier.', 'hire a van with driver, house removals, removal companies, furniture removal, move a piano, office relocation, rent a van', '2023-07-29 17:50:28', '2023-08-21 20:33:49'),

Proper planning and organization are essential to ensure a smooth transition and minimal disruption to your business operations. In this step-by-step <a href=\"http://easymoveeurope.com/\"><span style=\"color:#000000\">office relocation</span></a> checklist, we will guide you through the process, offering valuable insights on when to opt for a private van, semi-truck, or <a href=\"http://easymoveeurope.com/\"><span style=\"color:#000000\">tautliner truck</span></a>, depending on the volume of your office belongings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Step 1: Assessing Your Office Belongings</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Begin by taking stock of all your office belongings, including furniture, equipment, documents, and personal items. Create an inventory list to determine the volume and weight of the items you need to relocate. This assessment will help you decide whether a private van, semi-truck, or tautliner truck is best suited for your office move.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Step 2: Determining the Suitable Transportation Option</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>a) Private Van:</strong> <strong>Ideal for Small Office Moves</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If your office has a relatively small volume of belongings, a private van is an excellent choice. Private vans offer flexibility and are perfect for transporting a limited number of items efficiently. They are easy to maneuver in urban areas, making them suitable for office relocations within the city or nearby locations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Van average size: 420 x 210 x 230 cm, 19 cubic meters, and 1000 kg capacity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>b) Semi-Truck: Optimal for Medium-sized Office Moves</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For medium-sized office moves with a considerable volume of furniture and equipment, a <a href=\"http://easymoveeurope.com/\"><span style=\"color:#000000\">semi-truck</span></a> is a more suitable option. Semi-trucks provide ample space to accommodate a moderate amount of office belongings, and their sturdy construction ensures the safe transportation of goods over longer distances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Semi-truck average size: 610 x 220 x 250 cm, 33 cubic meters, and 3.500 kg capacity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>c) Tautliner Truck: Ideal for Large Office Moves</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For larger office relocations involving extensive furniture, equipment, and documents, a Tautliner truck is the most appropriate choice. Tautliner trucks offer a weather-resistant and secure enclosure with the capacity to handle substantial loads, making them the preferred option for long-distance and large-scale office moves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tautliner Truck average size: 1360 x 250 x 265 cm, 91 cubic meters, and 24000 kg capacity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Step 3: Hiring a Reputable Moving Company:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once you have determined the suitable transportation option based on your office belongings&#39; volume, it&#39;s time to hire a reputable moving company. Look for a company with experience in office relocations and a fleet of vehicles that match your specific requirements. Request quotes from multiple companies and compare their services, insurance coverage, and customer reviews before making a decision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Step 4: Creating a Comprehensive Moving Plan:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Develop a detailed moving plan that outlines the timelines, responsibilities, and sequence of tasks for your office relocation. Assign specific roles to employees, and communicate the plan to ensure everyone is on the same page. This will help streamline the moving process and minimize any potential disruptions to your business operations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Step 5: Packing and Labeling:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Efficiently pack and label your office belongings to ensure a smooth unpacking process at the new location. Use appropriate packing materials to safeguard delicate items, and clearly label each box or piece of furniture with its destination in the new office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Step 6: Coordinating the Move:&nbsp;</strong><br />\r\nCoordinate with the moving company to ensure they arrive on the scheduled day and time with the chosen transportation option - private van, semi-truck, or tautliner truck. Provide any specific instructions regarding the loading and unloading process, and stay in communication throughout the move.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Step 7: Post-Move Settling In:</strong>&nbsp;<br />\r\nOnce your office belongings have been safely transported to the new location, unpack systematically and organize your new office space efficiently. Prioritize setting up essential equipment and workstations to resume business operations promptly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Conclusion</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By following this step-by-step office relocation checklist and choosing the appropriate transportation option - private van, semi-truck, or tautliner truck, you can ensure a seamless and successful office move. Thorough planning, hiring a reputable moving company, and efficient coordination will lead to a stress-free relocation experience, allowing your business to flourish in its new workspace.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://easymoveeurope.com/\"><span style=\"color:#000000\">Hiring a Van</span></a>, Medium truck or Truck with a driver from Easy Move Europe to relocate your office is a convenient and reliable solution for a stress-free moving experience.

Thorough preparation will help you navigate the relocation journey smoothly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here is the list of documents that you will be required to provide if you are moving from one European country to the UK (Except Northern Ireland):&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Copy of ID;&nbsp;<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp;Proof of residence, proving that you have resided in Europe (or country of origin) for a minimum period of 6 months;&nbsp;<br />\r\n- Proof that you have a visa to reside in the United Kingdom (except for English citizens);&nbsp;<br />\r\n- Listed of the items with their value;&nbsp;<br />\r\n- ToR (<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/transfer-of-residence-to-great-britain \">Application for transfer of residence relief</a>):&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Step 2: Declutter and Organize</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before packing, declutter your belongings and organize them into categories for keep, sell, donate, or discard. Lightening your load will not only make the moving process easier but also reduce transportation costs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Step 3: Choose Easy Move Europe&#39;s Dedicated Van Service</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For hassle-free house removal to the United Kingdom, consider hiring a dedicated van with a driver from Easy Move Europe.

Use sturdy boxes, bubble wrap, and packing paper to safeguard fragile items. Label each box with its contents and designated room in your new UK home for easy unpacking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Step 5: Prepare Documentation</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ensure you have all necessary documents, including passports, visas, and residency permits, in order. Easy Move Europe&#39;s dedicated van service will guide you through any additional custom-related paperwork, making the process seamless.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Step 6: Inform Relevant Parties</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Notify utility providers, financial institutions, and healthcare providers about your <a href=\"https://easymoveeurope.com/\">relocation to the United Kingdom</a>.

Immerse yourself in the local customs and traditions to make your transition to the UK even more fulfilling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Conclusion</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A house removal to the United Kingdom is an exciting adventure, and with Easy Move Europe&#39;s <a href=\"https://easymoveeurope.com/\">dedicated van service</a>, it can be a smooth and stress-free experience.

Louez une Camionnette D&eacute;di&eacute;e avec Hayon :</strong><br />\r\nPour d&eacute;placer votre piano en toute s&eacute;curit&eacute; et efficacement, envisagez de louer une <a href=\"https://easymoveeurope.com/\">camionnette d&eacute;di&eacute;e avec</a> un hayon. Ce type de camionnette n&eacute;cessitera moins de personnes pour g&eacute;rer le d&eacute;m&eacute;nagement et offrira une option de transport s&eacute;curis&eacute;e et rapide pour votre pr&eacute;cieux instrument.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2. Pr&eacute;parez le Piano pour le Transport :</strong><br />\r\nAvant de charger le piano dans la camionnette, prenez les pr&eacute;cautions n&eacute;cessaires pour le prot&eacute;ger pendant le d&eacute;m&eacute;nagement. Utilisez des couvertures de d&eacute;m&eacute;nagement ou des serviettes &eacute;paisses pour couvrir le piano et fixez-les en place avec plusieurs couches de ruban adh&eacute;sif. Pour un piano vertical, assurez-vous d&#39;avoir un chariot capable de supporter son poids.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3. Mesurez les Portes, les Escaliers et les Couloirs :</strong><br />\r\nPour &eacute;viter toute difficult&eacute; lors du d&eacute;m&eacute;nagement, mesurez toutes les portes, les escaliers et les couloirs que le piano traversera &agrave; la fois dans votre emplacement actuel et dans le nouveau. Cette &eacute;tape vous aidera &agrave; planifier le meilleur itin&eacute;raire pour man&oelig;uvrer le piano et le support &agrave; piano &agrave; travers votre maison.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4. D&eacute;gagez le Chemin :</strong><br />\r\nAvant de d&eacute;placer le piano, assurez-vous que tous les chemins sont d&eacute;gag&eacute;s d&#39;obstacles et de meubles qui pourraient endommager l&#39;instrument. Couvrez les bords tranchants des portes avec des protecteurs pour b&eacute;b&eacute; ou des serviettes suppl&eacute;mentaires pour &eacute;viter les &eacute;raflures ou les &eacute;clats pendant le d&eacute;m&eacute;nagement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>5. Enlistez des Aides :</strong><br />\r\nBien que le conducteur de la camionnette puisse aider pour le d&eacute;m&eacute;nagement, avoir des amis, des membres de la famille ou des voisins disponibles pour aider, surtout pour les pianos plus lourds, peut rendre le processus plus fluide et plus s&ucirc;r.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>6. S&eacute;curisez le Piano dans la Camionnette :</strong><br />\r\nUne fois que le piano est correctement emball&eacute; et pr&ecirc;t pour le transport, utilisez des sangles &agrave; cliquet pour le fixer fermement &agrave; l&#39;int&eacute;rieur de la camionnette. Cela &eacute;vitera tout d&eacute;placement ou dommage potentiel pendant le transport. Lorsque vous louez une camionnette avec nous, le conducteur s&#39;en chargera pour vous.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>7. D&eacute;chargement du Piano :</strong><br />\r\nLors du d&eacute;chargement du piano de la camionnette, assurez-vous qu&#39;au moins une personne se trouve devant le piano pour un meilleur contr&ocirc;le et un guidage. Selon le poids du piano, vous pourriez avoir besoin de plus de personnes pour aider au processus de d&eacute;chargement en toute s&eacute;curit&eacute;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Apr&egrave;s le D&eacute;m&eacute;nagement :</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1. R&eacute;assemblage du Piano :</strong><br />\r\nSi vous poss&eacute;dez un piano &agrave; queue, demandez de l&#39;aide &agrave; des amis ou &agrave; des membres de la famille pour le r&eacute;assembler apr&egrave;s le d&eacute;m&eacute;nagement. Stabilisez le piano en r&eacute;attachant les pieds et en le remettant &agrave; la verticale.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2. Nettoyez l&#39;Ext&eacute;rieur :</strong><br />\r\nApr&egrave;s le d&eacute;m&eacute;nagement, essuyez le piano avec un chiffon doux et propre ou une plume pour enlever toute poussi&egrave;re accumul&eacute;e. &Eacute;vitez de nettoyer l&#39;int&eacute;rieur du piano vous-m&ecirc;me ; engagez plut&ocirc;t un service de nettoyage professionnel pour piano pour cette t&acirc;che d&eacute;licate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3. Accord du Piano :</strong><br />\r\nEn raison des changements environnementaux pendant le d&eacute;m&eacute;nagement, votre piano pourrait avoir besoin d&#39;&ecirc;tre accord&eacute;. Faites appel &agrave; un accordeur de piano professionnel pour vous assurer que votre piano est en condition optimale et produit le meilleur son.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>D&eacute;m&eacute;nager un piano sans d&eacute;m&eacute;nageurs professionnels peut &ecirc;tre un succ&egrave;s avec la bonne pr&eacute;paration, l&#39;&eacute;quipement et l&#39;aide de la famille et des amis. En suivant ces &eacute;tapes, vous pouvez d&eacute;m&eacute;nager votre piano en toute s&eacute;curit&eacute; et vous assurer qu&#39;il reste en bon &eacute;tat pendant de nombreuses ann&eacute;es &agrave; venir.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><a class=\"bbtn\" href=\"https://easymoveeurope.com/\">Obtenez un devis gratuit maintenant !</a></p>', '1', 'Déplacer un piano peut être une tâche difficile, mais avec la bonne approche et les bons outils, cela peut devenir beaucoup plus facile.', 'location d\'une camionnette avec chauffeur, déménagements de maison, entreprises de déménagement, déménagement de meubles, déplacer un piano, déménagement de bureau', '2023-08-08 14:00:00', '2023-08-08 14:00:00'),

Lorsqu&#39;il s&#39;agit de d&eacute;placer des marchandises &agrave; travers l&#39;Europe, louer une camionnette avec chauffeur offre une multitude d&#39;avantages qui peuvent rationaliser la logistique, stimuler la productivit&eacute; et garantir des livraisons en temps opportun. Dans ce blog, nous explorerons les raisons convaincantes pour lesquelles les entreprises devraient opter pour la location d&#39;une camionnette avec chauffeur pour leurs besoins de transport de marchandises &agrave; travers l&#39;Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1. Livraisons fluides et en temps voulu</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Une camionnette avec chauffeur offre une efficacit&eacute; in&eacute;gal&eacute;e dans le transport de marchandises. Avec leur expertise dans la navigation des routes europ&eacute;ennes diversifi&eacute;es et leur engagement envers la ponctualit&eacute;, vous pouvez vous attendre &agrave; des livraisons fluides et en temps opportun de vos marchandises. Cette fiabilit&eacute; est particuli&egrave;rement vitale pour maintenir la satisfaction des clients et construire une image de marque r&eacute;put&eacute;e.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2. Solutions flexibles et &eacute;volutives</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Les entreprises traitant des volumes de marchandises variables b&eacute;n&eacute;ficient grandement de la flexibilit&eacute; et de l&#39;&eacute;volutivit&eacute; offertes par la location d&#39;une camionnette avec chauffeur. Que vous ayez un petit envoi ou que vous ayez besoin de transporter des charges plus importantes, une camionnette avec chauffeur peut adapter les services pour r&eacute;pondre &agrave; vos besoins sp&eacute;cifiques, offrant des solutions rentables et adaptables.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3. Service client personnalis&eacute;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>La touche personnalis&eacute;e d&#39;une camionnette avec chauffeur peut faire toute la diff&eacute;rence dans le transport de marchandises. Vous avez un acc&egrave;s direct au chauffeur, ce qui vous permet de communiquer des mises &agrave; jour en temps r&eacute;el, des instructions sp&eacute;cifiques et tout changement dans le plan de livraison. Ce service client personnalis&eacute; favorise une meilleure communication et garantit que vos marchandises sont manipul&eacute;es avec le plus grand soin et attention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4. Transport &eacute;conomique</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Opter pour une camionnette avec chauffeur pour le transport de marchandises peut &ecirc;tre une solution &eacute;conomique pour les entreprises. Les services de fret traditionnels sont souvent assortis de co&ucirc;ts fixes, ind&eacute;pendamment du volume de marchandises. En revanche, la location d&#39;une camionnette avec chauffeur vous permet de payer uniquement l&#39;espace dont vous avez besoin, r&eacute;duisant les d&eacute;penses inutiles et offrant une option plus &eacute;conomique.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>5. Manipulation s&ucirc;re et fiable</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>La s&eacute;curit&eacute; de vos marchandises est d&#39;une importance primordiale.

Cependant, cela n&#39;a pas &agrave; &ecirc;tre ainsi !

Dans ce blog, nous explorerons les principales raisons pour lesquelles vous devriez envisager de louer une camionnette avec chauffeur pour votre prochain d&eacute;m&eacute;nagement de maison.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1. Expertise et Exp&eacute;rience</strong><br />\r\nUne camionnette avec chauffeur apporte une expertise et une exp&eacute;rience inestimables &agrave; votre d&eacute;m&eacute;nagement de maison. Les conducteurs professionnels sont bien vers&eacute;s dans la navigation de diff&eacute;rentes routes, la manipulation de diff&eacute;rents types de biens et la garantie du transport s&eacute;curis&eacute; de vos articles. Leur familiarit&eacute; avec les mod&egrave;les de circulation et les conditions routi&egrave;res signifie qu&#39;ils peuvent trouver le trajet le plus efficace et s&eacute;curis&eacute; vers votre nouvelle maison, vous faisant gagner du temps et du stress inutile.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2. Emballage et Chargement Sans Stress</strong><br />\r\nL&#39;emballage et le chargement de vos biens sont souvent les aspects les plus redoutables du d&eacute;m&eacute;nagement. Cependant, avec une camionnette et un chauffeur, vous pouvez souffler un soupir de soulagement. Ils vous aideront &agrave; charger vos articles de mani&egrave;re s&ucirc;re et syst&eacute;matique dans la camionnette, en veillant &agrave; ce que tout soit solidement attach&eacute; pour &eacute;viter tout d&eacute;placement pendant le transport. De plus, ils sont &eacute;quip&eacute;s des outils et de l&#39;&eacute;quipement n&eacute;cessaires pour manipuler m&ecirc;me les articles les plus difficiles, tels que les meubles lourds ou les antiquit&eacute;s d&eacute;licates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3. Solution &Eacute;conomique</strong><br />\r\nLouer une camionnette avec chauffeur peut &ecirc;tre une option &eacute;conomique par rapport &agrave; d&#39;autres services de d&eacute;m&eacute;nagement de maison. Avec les entreprises de d&eacute;m&eacute;nagement traditionnelles, vous devrez peut-&ecirc;tre payer des forfaits de service complet comprenant l&#39;emballage, le chargement et le transport. Avec une camionnette et un chauffeur, vous avez plus de contr&ocirc;le sur le processus et vous pouvez choisir de g&eacute;rer l&#39;emballage vous-m&ecirc;me, r&eacute;duisant ainsi les co&ucirc;ts globaux.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4. Flexibilit&eacute; et Commodit&eacute;</strong><br />\r\nL&#39;un des avantages les plus importants de la location d&#39;une camionnette avec chauffeur est la flexibilit&eacute; et la commodit&eacute; qu&#39;elle offre.

Que vous ayez besoin d&#39;un d&eacute;m&eacute;nagement le week-end ou d&#39;un d&eacute;m&eacute;nagement en soir&eacute;e, une camionnette avec chauffeur peut r&eacute;pondre &agrave; vos besoins en mati&egrave;re de timing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>5. Service Personnalis&eacute;</strong><br />\r\nLorsque vous louez une camionnette avec chauffeur, vous recevez une attention et des soins personnalis&eacute;s pour vos biens. Contrairement aux grandes entreprises de d&eacute;m&eacute;nagement, une camionnette et un chauffeur s&#39;occupent exclusivement de votre d&eacute;m&eacute;nagement de maison, vous donnant l&#39;assurance que vos articles sont manipul&eacute;s avec le plus grand soin et attention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>6. Connaissance Locale</strong><br />\r\nSi vous d&eacute;m&eacute;nagez dans la m&ecirc;me ville ou r&eacute;gion, un chauffeur ayant une connaissance locale peut &ecirc;tre un avantage significatif. Ils sont familiers avec la r&eacute;gion, les raccourcis et les zones de trafic potentielles, garantissant un processus de d&eacute;m&eacute;nagement plus fluide et plus rapide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Conclusion<br />\r\nLouer une camionnette avec chauffeur pour votre d&eacute;m&eacute;nagement de maison peut transformer une exp&eacute;rience potentiellement stressante en un voyage agr&eacute;able et efficace.

Cr&eacute;ez une liste d&#39;inventaire pour d&eacute;terminer le volume et le poids des articles que vous devez d&eacute;m&eacute;nager.

Les camionnettes priv&eacute;es offrent une flexibilit&eacute; et sont parfaites pour transporter un nombre limit&eacute; d&#39;articles de mani&egrave;re efficace. Elles sont faciles &agrave; man&oelig;uvrer dans les zones urbaines, ce qui les rend adapt&eacute;es aux d&eacute;m&eacute;nagements de bureau dans la ville ou les environs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Taille moyenne de la camionnette : 420 x 210 x 230 cm, 19 m&egrave;tres cubes et capacit&eacute; de 1000 kg.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>b) Camion Semi-Remorque </strong>: Optimal pour les D&eacute;m&eacute;nagements de Bureau de Taille Moyenne</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pour les d&eacute;m&eacute;nagements de bureau de taille moyenne avec un volume consid&eacute;rable de meubles et d&#39;&eacute;quipements, un camion semi-remorque est une option plus appropri&eacute;e.

Accordez la priorit&eacute; &agrave; l&#39;installation de l&#39;&eacute;quipement essentiel et des postes de travail pour reprendre rapidement les op&eacute;rations commerciales.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Conclusion</p>\r\n\r\n<p>En suivant cette liste de contr&ocirc;le &eacute;tape par &eacute;tape pour le d&eacute;m&eacute;nagement de bureau et en choisissant l&#39;option de transport appropri&eacute;e - camionnette priv&eacute;e, camion semi-remorque ou camion tautliner, vous pouvez garantir un d&eacute;m&eacute;nagement de bureau sans faille et r&eacute;ussi.

Cependant, cela ne doit pas forc&eacute;ment &ecirc;tre le cas ! Louer un camion avec chauffeur peut rendre votre exp&eacute;rience de d&eacute;m&eacute;nagement de maison fluide, efficace et sans tracas. Dans cet article, nous explorerons les principales raisons pour lesquelles vous devriez envisager de louer un camion avec chauffeur pour votre prochain d&eacute;m&eacute;nagement de maison.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1- Expertise et Exp&eacute;rience</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Un camion avec chauffeur apporte une expertise et une exp&eacute;rience inestimables &agrave; votre d&eacute;m&eacute;nagement. Les conducteurs professionnels sont aguerris &agrave; naviguer sur diff&eacute;rentes routes, &agrave; manipuler diff&eacute;rents types de biens et &agrave; assurer le transport s&eacute;curis&eacute; de vos articles. Leur connaissance des sch&eacute;mas de circulation et des conditions routi&egrave;res leur permet de trouver l&#39;itin&eacute;raire le plus efficace et s&ucirc;r vers votre nouveau domicile, vous faisant gagner du temps et &eacute;vitant un stress inutile.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2- Emballage et Chargement Sans Stress</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>L&#39;emballage et le chargement de vos biens sont souvent les aspects les plus redoutables du d&eacute;m&eacute;nagement. Cependant, avec un camion et un chauffeur, vous pouvez souffler. Ils vous aideront &agrave; charger vos articles en toute s&eacute;curit&eacute; et syst&eacute;matiquement dans le camion, en veillant &agrave; ce que tout soit solidement attach&eacute; pour &eacute;viter tout d&eacute;placement pendant le transport. De plus, ils sont &eacute;quip&eacute;s des outils et du mat&eacute;riel n&eacute;cessaires pour manipuler m&ecirc;me les articles les plus difficiles, tels que les meubles lourds ou les objets d&eacute;licats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3- Solution Rentable</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>La location d&#39;un camion avec chauffeur peut &ecirc;tre une option rentable par rapport &agrave; d&#39;autres services de d&eacute;m&eacute;nagement de maison. Avec les entreprises de d&eacute;m&eacute;nagement traditionnelles, vous pourriez devoir payer des forfaits de services complets comprenant l&#39;emballage, le chargement et le transport. Avec un camion et un chauffeur, vous avez plus de contr&ocirc;le sur le processus et pouvez choisir de g&eacute;rer l&#39;emballage vous-m&ecirc;me, r&eacute;duisant ainsi les co&ucirc;ts globaux.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4- Flexibilit&eacute; et Commodit&eacute;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>L&#39;un des avantages les plus importants de la location d&#39;un camion avec chauffeur est la flexibilit&eacute; et la commodit&eacute; qu&#39;elle offre. Vous pouvez personnaliser l&#39;emploi du temps selon vos pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences, en veillant &agrave; ce que votre d&eacute;m&eacute;nagement de maison s&#39;adapte &agrave; votre emploi du temps charg&eacute;. Que vous ayez besoin d&#39;un d&eacute;m&eacute;nagement le week-end ou d&#39;une relocalisation en soir&eacute;e, un camion avec chauffeur peut r&eacute;pondre &agrave; vos besoins en mati&egrave;re de timing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>5- Service Personnalis&eacute;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lorsque vous louez un camion avec chauffeur, vous recevez une attention et des soins personnalis&eacute;s pour vos biens. Contrairement aux grandes entreprises de d&eacute;m&eacute;nagement, un camion et un chauffeur se consacrent exclusivement &agrave; votre d&eacute;m&eacute;nagement de maison, vous donnant la tranquillit&eacute; d&#39;esprit que vos articles sont manipul&eacute;s avec le plus grand soin et attention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>6- Connaissance Locale</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Si vous d&eacute;m&eacute;nagez dans la m&ecirc;me ville ou r&eacute;gion, un chauffeur ayant une connaissance locale peut &ecirc;tre un avantage significatif. Ils sont familiers avec la r&eacute;gion, les raccourcis et les zones de circulation potentiellement probl&eacute;matiques, assurant un processus de relocalisation plus fluide et plus rapide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Conclusion</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Louer un camion avec chauffeur pour votre d&eacute;m&eacute;nagement de maison peut transformer une exp&eacute;rience potentiellement stressante en un voyage agr&eacute;able et efficace.

Es muss jedoch nicht so sein! Die Anmietung eines Lieferwagens mit Fahrer kann Ihr Hausumzugserlebnis reibungslos, effizient und stressfrei gestalten. In diesem Blog werden wir die wichtigsten Gr&uuml;nde erkunden, warum Sie in Erw&auml;gung ziehen sollten, einen Lieferwagen mit Fahrer f&uuml;r Ihren bevorstehenden Hausumzug zu mieten.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1. Fachkenntnisse und Erfahrung</strong><br />\r\nEin Lieferwagen mit Fahrer bringt unsch&auml;tzbare Fachkenntnisse und Erfahrung in Ihren Hausumzug ein. Professionelle Fahrer sind versiert im Navigieren verschiedener Routen, im Umgang mit verschiedenen Arten von Habseligkeiten und in der sicheren Bef&ouml;rderung Ihrer Gegenst&auml;nde. Ihre Vertrautheit mit Verkehrsmustern und Stra&szlig;enbedingungen erm&ouml;glicht es ihnen, die effizienteste und sicherste Route zu Ihrem neuen Zuhause zu finden und Ihnen Zeit und unn&ouml;tigen Stress zu ersparen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2. Stressfreies Packen und Verladen</strong><br />\r\nDas Packen und Verladen Ihrer Habseligkeiten ist oft der schwierigste Aspekt eines Hausumzugs. Mit einem Lieferwagen und Fahrer k&ouml;nnen Sie aufatmen. Sie werden Ihnen beim sicheren und systematischen Verladen Ihrer Gegenst&auml;nde in den Lieferwagen helfen und darauf achten, dass alles sicher befestigt ist, um ein Verschieben w&auml;hrend des Transports zu verhindern. Au&szlig;erdem sind sie mit den erforderlichen Werkzeugen und Ger&auml;ten ausgestattet, um selbst mit den schwierigsten Gegenst&auml;nden wie schweren M&ouml;beln oder empfindlichen Antiquit&auml;ten umzugehen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3. Kostenef?ziente L&ouml;sung</strong><br />\r\nDie Anmietung eines Lieferwagens mit Fahrer kann im Vergleich zu anderen Hausumzugsdienstleistungen eine kosteng&uuml;nstige Option sein. Bei herk&ouml;mmlichen Umzugsunternehmen m&uuml;ssen Sie m&ouml;glicherweise f&uuml;r Full-Service-Pakete zahlen, die das Packen, Verladen und den Transport umfassen. Mit einem Lieferwagen und Fahrer haben Sie mehr Kontrolle &uuml;ber den Prozess und k&ouml;nnen entscheiden, ob Sie das Packen selbst &uuml;bernehmen m&ouml;chten, um die Gesamtkosten zu reduzieren.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4. Flexibilit&auml;t und Bequemlichkeit</strong><br />\r\nEiner der gr&ouml;&szlig;ten Vorteile bei der Anmietung eines Lieferwagens mit Fahrer ist die Flexibilit&auml;t und Bequemlichkeit, die er bietet. Sie k&ouml;nnen den Zeitplan nach Ihren W&uuml;nschen anpassen, um sicherzustellen, dass Ihr Hausumzug in Ihren vollen Terminkalender passt. Ob Sie einen Umzug am Wochenende oder am Abend ben&ouml;tigen, ein Lieferwagen mit Fahrer kann Ihre zeitlichen Anforderungen ber&uuml;cksichtigen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>5. Pers&ouml;nlicher Service</strong><br />\r\nWenn Sie einen Lieferwagen mit Fahrer mieten, erhalten Sie pers&ouml;nliche Aufmerksamkeit und Sorgfalt f&uuml;r Ihre Habseligkeiten. Anders als gro&szlig;e Umzugsunternehmen konzentriert sich ein Lieferwagen mit Fahrer ausschlie&szlig;lich auf Ihren Hausumzug und gibt Ihnen die Gewissheit, dass Ihre Gegenst&auml;nde mit gr&ouml;&szlig;ter Sorgfalt behandelt werden.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>6. Lokales Wissen</strong><br />\r\nWenn Sie innerhalb derselben Stadt oder Region umziehen, kann ein Fahrer mit Ortskenntnissen von gro&szlig;em Vorteil sein. Er kennt sich mit der Gegend, Abk&uuml;rzungen und potenziellen Verkehrshindernissen aus und gew&auml;hrleistet so einen reibungsloseren und schnelleren Umzugsprozess.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fazit<br />\r\nDie Anmietung eines Lieferwagens mit Fahrer f&uuml;r Ihren Hausumzug kann ein potenziell stressiges Erlebnis in eine angenehme und effiziente Reise verwandeln. Mit ihrer Fachkenntnis, dem stressfreien Packen und Verladen, der Kostenef?zienz, Flexibilit&auml;t, pers&ouml;nlichen Betreuung und Ortskenntnis k&ouml;nnen Sie sicher sein, dass Ihre Habseligkeiten in sicheren H&auml;nden sind. Nutzen Sie die Bequemlichkeit und die Beruhigung, die ein Lieferwagen mit Fahrer bietet, und machen Sie Ihren Hausumzug zu einem unvergesslichen und positiven Erlebnis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><a class=\"bbtn\" href=\"https://easymoveeurope.com/\">Jetzt ein kostenloses Angebot erhalten!</a></p>', '1', 'Der Umzug in ein neues Haus ist eine aufregende Reise, aber der Prozess des Hausumzugs kann überwältigend und stressig sein.', 'Lieferwagen mit Fahrer mieten, Hausumzüge, Umzugsunternehmen, Umzugsfirma, Möbeltransport, lokale Umzugshelfer, Mann-und-Van-Service', '2023-08-18 18:53:38', '2023-08-18 18:53:38'),

Wenn Sie Ihr Klavier umziehen m&ouml;chten, ohne Unsummen f&uuml;r professionelle Umzugsunternehmen auszugeben, befolgen Sie diese Schritte, um eine sichere und reibungslose Umsiedlung zu gew&auml;hrleisten.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1. Mieten Sie einen speziellen Lieferwagen mit Ladebordwand:</strong><br />\r\nUm Ihr Klavier sicher und effizient zu transportieren, sollten Sie in Betracht ziehen, einen dedizierten Lieferwagen mit Ladebordwand zu mieten. Diese Art von Lieferwagen erfordert weniger Personen, um den Umzug zu bew&auml;ltigen, und bietet eine sichere und schnelle Transportm&ouml;glichkeit f&uuml;r Ihr wertvolles Instrument.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2. Bereiten Sie das Klavier f&uuml;r den Transport vor:</strong><br />\r\nBevor Sie das Klavier in den Lieferwagen laden, ergreifen Sie die notwendigen Vorsichtsma&szlig;nahmen, um es w&auml;hrend des Transports zu sch&uuml;tzen. Verwenden Sie Umzugsdecken oder dicke Handt&uuml;cher, um das Klavier abzudecken, und sichern Sie sie mit mehreren Rollen Klebeband. F&uuml;r ein aufrechtes Klavier stellen Sie sicher, dass Sie ein Transportgestell haben, das sein Gewicht tragen kann.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3. Messen Sie T&uuml;ren, Treppen und Flure:</strong><br />\r\nUm Schwierigkeiten w&auml;hrend des Umzugs zu vermeiden, messen Sie alle T&uuml;ren, Treppen und Flure, durch die das Klavier sowohl an Ihrem aktuellen als auch an Ihrem neuen Standort gehen wird. Dieser Schritt wird Ihnen helfen, die beste Route f&uuml;r das Man&ouml;vrieren des Klaviers und des Klavierbretts in Ihrem Zuhause zu planen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4. R&auml;umen Sie den Weg:</strong><br />\r\nBevor Sie das Klavier bewegen, stellen Sie sicher, dass alle Wege frei von Hindernissen und M&ouml;beln sind, die das Instrument m&ouml;glicherweise besch&auml;digen k&ouml;nnten. Decken Sie scharfe Kanten von T&uuml;ren mit Kindersicherheitspuffern oder zus&auml;tzlichen Handt&uuml;chern ab, um Kratzer oder Absch&uuml;rfungen w&auml;hrend des Transports zu vermeiden.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>5. Helfer engagieren:</strong><br />\r\nW&auml;hrend der Fahrer des Lieferwagens beim Umzug helfen kann, k&ouml;nnen einige Freunde, Familienmitglieder oder Nachbarn, insbesondere bei schweren Klavieren, den Vorgang reibungsloser und sicherer gestalten.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>6. Sichern Sie das Klavier im Lieferwagen:</strong><br />\r\nSobald das Klavier ordnungsgem&auml;&szlig; verpackt und transportbereit ist, verwenden Sie Spanngurte, um es fest im Inneren des Lieferwagens zu sichern. Dies verhindert jegliches Verschieben oder m&ouml;gliche Besch&auml;digungen w&auml;hrend des Transports. Wenn Sie einen Lieferwagen bei uns mieten, wird der Fahrer dies f&uuml;r Sie erledigen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>7. Klavier entladen:</strong><br />\r\nBeim Entladen des Klaviers aus dem Lieferwagen sollte mindestens eine Person vor dem Klavier stehen, um eine bessere Kontrolle und F&uuml;hrung zu gew&auml;hrleisten. Abh&auml;ngig vom Gewicht des Klaviers ben&ouml;tigen Sie m&ouml;glicherweise mehr Personen, um beim sicheren Entladevorgang zu helfen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Nach dem Umzug:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1. Klavier wieder zusammenbauen:</strong><br />\r\nWenn Sie ein Fl&uuml;gelklavier besitzen, holen Sie sich Hilfe von Familie und Freunden, um es nach dem Umzug wieder zusammenzubauen. Stabilisieren Sie das Klavier, w&auml;hrend Sie die Beine wieder anbringen und es wieder aufrecht stellen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2. Reinigen Sie die Oberfl&auml;che:</strong><br />\r\nNach dem Umzug wischen Sie das Klavier mit einem weichen, sauberen Tuch oder einem Federstaubtuch ab, um eventuell angesammelten Staub zu entfernen. Vermeiden Sie das Reinigen des Inneren des Klaviers selbst; stattdessen sollten Sie einen professionellen Klavierreinigungsdienst f&uuml;r diese empfindliche Aufgabe beauftragen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3. Klavierstimmen:</strong><br />\r\nAufgrund von Umweltver&auml;nderungen w&auml;hrend des Umzugs muss Ihr Klavier m&ouml;glicherweise gestimmt werden. Rufen Sie einen professionellen Klavierstimmer an, um sicherzustellen, dass Ihr Klavier in optimalem Zustand ist und den besten Klang produziert.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ein Klavier ohne professionelle Umzugsunternehmen zu transportieren, kann mit der richtigen Vorbereitung, Ausr&uuml;stung und Hilfe von Familie und Freunden erfolgreich sein. Indem Sie diesen Schritten folgen, k&ouml;nnen Sie Ihr Klavier sicher umziehen und sicherstellen, dass es jahrelang in Top-Zustand bleibt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><a class=\"bbtn\" href=\"https://easymoveeurope.com/\">Jetzt ein kostenloses Angebot erhalten!</a></p>', '1', 'Wenn Sie Ihr Klavier umziehen möchten, ohne Unsummen für professionelle Umzugsunternehmen auszugeben, befolgen Sie diese Schritte, um eine sichere und reibungslose Umsiedlung zu gewährleisten.', 'Lieferwagen mit Fahrer mieten, Hausumzüge, Umzugsunternehmen, Möbeltransport, Klaviertransport, Büroumzug, rent a van', '2023-08-21 17:18:46', '2023-08-21 17:18:46'),

Do you have only these two types of vans and measurements? No, we have other types, models and sizes of vans. The size you see in the description is an average, sizes may vary. We will always try to maintain the capacity contracted by you (13 and 19 cubic meters), so it is important that you provide us with as much information as possible about your cargo so that we can send you the appropriate van. To transport dangerous items we also have the ADR van and to transport perishable items that need controlled temperature, we have the refrigerated vans, which can be hired separately, just contact us via email or phone and we will provide you with a quote. Will the driver always help to load/unload the load? No, please note that the driver\'s main focus is driving and he will help load and/or unload the cargo if this is contracted to at the time you hire the transport. Please note that not all drivers are physically able to help, so you need to let us know in advance so that the ideal driver is chosen. How does the help service work? When you hire the help service, you need to consider that the driver will help to load/unload from the first floor level to the van and vice versa. For cases where loading/unloading is in apartments that do not have an elevator, you need to let us know in advance, as not all drivers are physically able to go up and down stairs. What can’t be shipped? Hazardous goods: e.g. firearms, explosives, ammunition, hazardous materials, radioactives. Illegal goods: Drugs, endangered species, other products illegal under EU laws. Livestock: Live stock animals, horses, pets, mice, worms, insects. Money: Currencies, banknotes and coins. Securities: Bonds, stocks, negotiable documents and all types of securities. About custom procedures, when should I be concerned and who should take care of it for me? For transport within the EU, no special documentation is usually required, but when the country of origin or destination is not part of the European Union, the customer always needs to prepare the documentation in advance. Each country has different rules, so you can consult us and we will guide you through this process.In some cases you will be able to prepare the necessary documentation only with our help, but most of the time it is a broker that will carry out this work. How to pack the goods for shipping? With the dedicated van delivery, you do not need to package your shipment in any specific way. The shipper is able to accommodate the goods in the van however they like, packed or not. However, note that in the movement of the van on the highway one item can crash into the other causing damage and no one wants that to happen, so we still recommend protecting your goods for transport to avoid damage.

Wie funktioniert der Hilfedienst? Wenn Sie den Hilfsdienst beauftragen, müssen Sie berücksichtigen, dass der Fahrer beim Be- und Entladen vom ersten Stock in den Transporter und umgekehrt hilft.

In jedem Land gelten unterschiedliche Regeln. Sie können sich also an uns wenden und wir werden Sie durch diesen Prozess begleiten. In einigen Fällen können Sie die erforderlichen Unterlagen nur mit unserer Hilfe erstellen, aber in den meisten Fällen übernimmt ein Makler die Arbeit diese Arbeit. Wie verpacke ich die Ware für den Versand? Bei der Zustellung per Lieferwagen müssen Sie Ihre Sendung nicht auf eine bestimmte Art und Weise verpacken. Der Versender kann die Ware im Lieferwagen beliebig unterbringen, ob verpackt oder nicht. Beachten Sie jedoch, dass bei der Bewegung des Lieferwagens auf der Autobahn ein Gegenstand gegen den anderen stoßen und Schäden verursachen kann, und niemand möchte, dass dies geschieht. Wir empfehlen daher dennoch, Ihre Waren für den Transport zu schützen, um Schäden zu vermeiden.

Yes, every shipment with our dedicated van delivery is covered by CMR conventions and extended liability is also available (for commercial shipments). The value is currently around 10 euros per kilo and apply to occurrence of theft, damaged goods, gross negligence in international and domestic transport. Do you have only these two types of vans and measurements? No, we have other types, models and sizes of vans. The size you see in the description is an average, sizes may vary. We will always try to maintain the capacity contracted by you (13 and 19 cubic meters), so it is important that you provide us with as much information as possible about your cargo so that we can send you the appropriate van. To transport dangerous items we also have the ADR van and to transport perishable items that need controlled temperature, we have the refrigerated vans, which can be hired separately, just contact us via email or phone and we will provide you with a quote. Will the driver always help to load/unload the load? No, please note that the driver\'s main focus is driving and he will help load and/or unload the cargo if this is contracted to at the time you hire the transport. Please note that not all drivers are physically able to help, so you need to let us know in advance so that the ideal driver is chosen. How does the help service work? When you hire the help service, you need to consider that the driver will help to load/unload from the first floor level to the van and vice versa. For cases where loading/unloading is in apartments that do not have an elevator, you need to let us know in advance, as not all drivers are physically able to go up and down stairs. What can’t be shipped? Hazardous goods: e.g. firearms, explosives, ammunition, hazardous materials, radioactives. Illegal goods: Drugs, endangered species, other products illegal under EU laws. Livestock: Live stock animals, horses, pets, mice, worms, insects. Money: Currencies, banknotes and coins. Securities: Bonds, stocks, negotiable documents and all types of securities. About custom procedures, when should I be concerned and who should take care of it for me? For transport within the EU, no special documentation is usually required, but when the country of origin or destination is not part of the European Union, the customer always needs to prepare the documentation in advance. Each country has different rules, so you can consult us and we will guide you through this process.In some cases you will be able to prepare the necessary documentation only with our help, but most of the time it is a broker that will carry out this work. How to pack the goods for shipping? With the dedicated van delivery, you do not need to package your shipment in any specific way. The shipper is able to accommodate the goods in the van however they like, packed or not. However, note that in the movement of the van on the highway one item can crash into the other causing damage and no one wants that to happen, so we still recommend protecting your goods for transport to avoid damage.

Oui, chaque expédition avec notre livraison par camion dédiée est couverte par les conventions CMR et une responsabilité étendue est également disponible (pour les expéditions commerciales). La valeur est actuellement d&#39;environ 10 euros par kilo et s&#39;applique en cas de vol, de marchandises endommagées et de négligence grave dans le transport international et national. Avez-vous uniquement ces deux types de fourgons et ces mesures ? Non, nous avons d&#39;autres types, modèles et tailles de fourgonnettes. La taille que vous voyez dans la description est une moyenne, les tailles peuvent varier. Nous essaierons toujours de maintenir la capacité contractée par vous (13 et 19 mètres cubes), il est donc important que vous nous fournissiez autant d&#39;informations que possible sur votre cargaison afin que nous puissions vous envoyer la camionnette appropriée. Pour transporter des objets dangereux, nous disposons également du fourgon ADR et pour transporter des denrées périssables nécessitant une température contrôlée, nous disposons de fourgons réfrigérés, qui peuvent être loués séparément, il suffit de nous contacter par e-mail ou par téléphone et nous vous ferons un devis. Le chauffeur aidera-t-il toujours à charger/décharger la charge ? Non, veuillez noter que l&#39;objectif principal du chauffeur est la conduite et qu&#39;il aidera à charger et/ou décharger la cargaison si cela est convenu au moment où vous engagez le transport. Veuillez noter que tous les chauffeurs ne sont pas physiquement capables de vous aider, vous devez donc nous en informer à l&#39;avance afin que le chauffeur idéal soit choisi. Comment fonctionne le service d&#39;aide ? Lorsque vous faites appel au service d&#39;assistance, vous devez considérer que le chauffeur vous aidera à charger/décharger du premier étage jusqu&#39;au fourgon et vice versa. Dans les cas où le chargement/déchargement s&#39;effectue dans des appartements ne disposant pas d&#39;ascenseur, vous devez nous en informer à l&#39;avance, car tous les conducteurs ne sont pas physiquement capables de monter et de descendre les escaliers.

Concernant les procédures douanières, quand dois-je m&#39;en inquiéter et qui doit s&#39;en occuper à ma place ? Pour le transport au sein de l&#39;UE, aucun document spécial n&#39;est généralement requis, mais lorsque le pays d&#39;origine ou de destination ne fait pas partie de l&#39;Union européenne, le client doit toujours préparer la documentation à l&#39;avance. Chaque pays a des règles différentes, vous pouvez donc nous consulter et nous vous guiderons dans ce processus. Dans certains cas, vous ne pourrez préparer la documentation nécessaire qu&#39;avec notre aide, mais la plupart du temps, c&#39;est un courtier qui réalisera ce travail. Comment emballer les marchandises pour l’expédition ? Avec la livraison par camionnette dédiée, vous n’avez pas besoin d’emballer votre envoi d’une manière spécifique. L&#39;expéditeur est en mesure d&#39;accueillir les marchandises dans la camionnette comme il le souhaite, emballées ou non. Cependant, sachez que lors du déplacement de la camionnette sur l&#39;autoroute, un objet peut s&#39;écraser sur l&#39;autre, provoquant des dommages et personne ne souhaite que cela se produise. Nous vous recommandons donc de protéger vos marchandises pendant le transport afin d&#39;éviter tout dommage.

The shipper is able to accommodate the goods in the van however they like, packed or not.

Each country has different rules, so you can consult us and we will guide you through this process.In some cases you will be able to prepare the necessary documentation only with our help, but most of the time it is a broker that will carry out this work.

The shipper is able to accommodate the goods in the van however they like, packed or not. However, note that in the movement of the van on the highway one item can crash into the other causing damage and no one wants that to happen, so we still recommend protecting your goods for transport to avoid damage.

Yes, every shipment with our dedicated van delivery is covered by CMR conventions and extended liability is also available (for commercial shipments). The value is currently around 10 euros per kilo and apply to occurrence of theft, damaged goods, gross negligence in international and domestic transport. Do you have only these two types of vans and measurements? No, we have other types, models and sizes of vans. The size you see in the description is an average, sizes may vary. We will always try to maintain the capacity contracted by you (13 and 19 cubic meters), so it is important that you provide us with as much information as possible about your cargo so that we can send you the appropriate van. To transport dangerous items we also have the ADR van and to transport perishable items that need controlled temperature, we have the refrigerated vans, which can be hired separately, just contact us via email or phone and we will provide you with a quote. Will the driver always help to load/unload the load? No, please note that the driver\'s main focus is driving and he will help load and/or unload the cargo if this is contracted to at the time you hire the transport. Please note that not all drivers are physically able to help, so you need to let us know in advance so that the ideal driver is chosen. How does the help service work? When you hire the help service, you need to consider that the driver will help to load/unload from the first floor level to the van and vice versa. For cases where loading/unloading is in apartments that do not have an elevator, you need to let us know in advance, as not all drivers are physically able to go up and down stairs. What can’t be shipped? Hazardous goods: e.g. firearms, explosives, ammunition, hazardous materials, radioactives. Illegal goods: Drugs, endangered species, other products illegal under EU laws. Livestock: Live stock animals, horses, pets, mice, worms, insects. Money: Currencies, banknotes and coins. Securities: Bonds, stocks, negotiable documents and all types of securities. About custom procedures, when should I be concerned and who should take care of it for me? For transport within the EU, no special documentation is usually required, but when the country of origin or destination is not part of the European Union, the customer always needs to prepare the documentation in advance. Each country has different rules, so you can consult us and we will guide you through this process.In some cases you will be able to prepare the necessary documentation only with our help, but most of the time it is a broker that will carry out this work. How to pack the goods for shipping? With the dedicated van delivery, you do not need to package your shipment in any specific way. The shipper is able to accommodate the goods in the van however they like, packed or not. However, note that in the movement of the van on the highway one item can crash into the other causing damage and no one wants that to happen, so we still recommend protecting your goods for transport to avoid damage.

Observe que nem todos os motoristas têm condições físicas de ajudar, por isso é necessário nos avisar com antecedência para que o motorista ideal seja escolhido. Como funciona o serviço de ajuda? Ao contratar o serviço de ajuda, é preciso considerar que o motorista ajudará na carga/descarga do primeiro andar até a van e vice-versa. Para os casos em que a carga/descarga é em apartamentos que não possuem elevador, é necessário avisar com antecedência, pois nem todos os motoristas têm condições físicas de subir e descer escadas. O que não pode ser enviado? Mercadorias perigosas: por exemplo, armas de fogo, explosivos, munições, materiais perigosos, radioativos. Mercadorias ilegais: Drogas, espécies ameaçadas, outros produtos ilegais ao abrigo das leis da UE. Pecuária: Animais vivos, cavalos, animais de estimação, ratos, vermes, insetos. Dinheiro: Moedas, notas e moedas. Valores Mobiliários: Títulos, ações, documentos negociáveis e todos os tipos de valores mobiliários. Sobre procedimentos personalizados, quando devo me preocupar e quem deve cuidar disso para mim? Para o transporte dentro da UE normalmente não é necessária documentação especial, mas quando o país de origem ou destino não faz parte da União Europeia, o cliente necessita sempre de preparar a documentação com antecedência. Cada país possui regras diferentes, por isso você pode nos consultar e nós o orientaremos neste processo. Em alguns casos você poderá preparar a documentação necessária apenas com a nossa ajuda, mas na maioria das vezes é um corretor que fará Este trabalho. Como embalar as mercadorias para envio? Com a entrega em van dedicada, você não precisa embalar sua remessa de nenhuma maneira específica. O expedidor pode acomodar a mercadoria na van como quiser, embalada ou não. Porém, observe que na movimentação da van na rodovia um item pode bater no outro causando danos e ninguém quer que isso aconteça, por isso ainda recomendamos proteger sua mercadoria para transporte para evitar danos.

Do you have only these two types of vans and measurements? No, we have other types, models and sizes of vans. The size you see in the description is an average, sizes may vary. We will always try to maintain the capacity contracted by you (13 and 19 cubic meters), so it is important that you provide us with as much information as possible about your cargo so that we can send you the appropriate van. To transport dangerous items we also have the ADR van and to transport perishable items that need controlled temperature, we have the refrigerated vans, which can be hired separately, just contact us via email or phone and we will provide you with a quote. Will the driver always help to load/unload the load? No, please note that the driver\'s main focus is driving and he will help load and/or unload the cargo if this is contracted to at the time you hire the transport. Please note that not all drivers are physically able to help, so you need to let us know in advance so that the ideal driver is chosen. How does the help service work? When you hire the help service, you need to consider that the driver will help to load/unload from the first floor level to the van and vice versa. For cases where loading/unloading is in apartments that do not have an elevator, you need to let us know in advance, as not all drivers are physically able to go up and down stairs. What can’t be shipped? Hazardous goods: e.g. firearms, explosives, ammunition, hazardous materials, radioactives. Illegal goods: Drugs, endangered species, other products illegal under EU laws.

About custom procedures, when should I be concerned and who should take care of it for me? For transport within the EU, no special documentation is usually required, but when the country of origin or destination is not part of the European Union, the customer always needs to prepare the documentation in advance. Each country has different rules, so you can consult us and we will guide you through this process.In some cases you will be able to prepare the necessary documentation only with our help, but most of the time it is a broker that will carry out this work. How to pack the goods for shipping? With the dedicated van delivery, you do not need to package your shipment in any specific way. The shipper is able to accommodate the goods in the van however they like, packed or not. However, note that in the movement of the van on the highway one item can crash into the other causing damage and no one wants that to happen, so we still recommend protecting your goods for transport to avoid damage.

Dla Twojej firmy lub w przypadku przeprowadzki prywatnej usługa dostawy vanem jest idealnym rozwiązaniem”. Zalety: Indywidualny czas odbioru i dostawy - Odbiór i dostawy w weekendy, w dzień i w nocy - Możliwość odbioru tego samego dnia w przypadku pilnego transportu Transport ciężkich i nieporęcznych przedmiotów - Nie jest wymagane specjalne opakowanie - Idealne do transportu delikatnych przedmiotów Często zadawane pytania Często zadawane pytania Pytania Czy wynajem vana obejmuje jakieś ubezpieczenie? Tak, każda przesyłka naszą dedykowaną dostawą vana objęta jest konwencjami CMR i dostępna jest również rozszerzona odpowiedzialność (w przypadku przesyłek komercyjnych). Wartość ta wynosi obecnie około 10 euro za kilogram i dotyczy wystąpienia kradzieży, uszkodzenia towaru, rażącego zaniedbania w transporcie międzynarodowym i krajowym. Czy macie tylko te dwa typy vanów i wymiary? Nie, posiadamy inne typy, modele i rozmiary samochodów dostawczych. Rozmiar widoczny w opisie jest średni, rozmiary mogą się różnić. Zawsze będziemy starali się utrzymać zakontraktowaną przez Ciebie pojemność (13 i 19 metrów sześciennych), dlatego ważne jest, abyś przekazał nam jak najwięcej informacji o swoim ładunku, abyśmy mogli wysłać Ci odpowiedni samochód dostawczy. Do transportu towarów niebezpiecznych dysponujemy również samochodem dostawczym ADR, a do transportu towarów łatwo psujących się, które wymagają kontrolowanej temperatury, posiadamy samochody chłodnie, które można wynająć osobno. Wystarczy skontaktować się z nami e-mailem lub telefonicznie, a my przedstawimy Państwu wycenę. Czy kierowca zawsze pomoże w załadunku/rozładunku ładunku? Nie, należy pamiętać, że głównym zadaniem kierowcy jest prowadzenie pojazdu i pomaga on załadować i/lub rozładować ładunek, jeśli jest to określone w umowie w momencie wynajmu transportu. Należy pamiętać, że nie wszyscy kierowcy są fizycznie w stanie pomóc, dlatego należy nas o tym poinformować z wyprzedzeniem, aby wybrać idealnego kierowcę. Jak działa usługa pomocy? Zatrudniając usługę pomocy, należy wziąć pod uwagę, że kierowca pomoże w załadunku/rozładunku z poziomu pierwszego piętra do furgonetki i odwrotnie. W przypadkach, gdy załadunek/rozładunek odbywa się w mieszkaniach, które nie mają windy, należy nas o tym poinformować z wyprzedzeniem, ponieważ nie wszyscy kierowcy są fizycznie zdolni do wchodzenia i schodzenia po schodach. Czego nie można wysłać? Towary niebezpieczne: np. broń palna, materiały wybuchowe, amunicja, materiały niebezpieczne, materiały radioaktywne. Towary nielegalne: Narkotyki, gatunki zagrożone, inne produkty nielegalne na mocy prawa UE. Zwierzęta gospodarskie: Zwierzęta hodowlane, konie, zwierzęta domowe, myszy, robaki, owady. Pieniądze: Waluty, banknoty i monety. Papiery wartościowe: obligacje, akcje, dokumenty zbywalne i wszelkiego rodzaju papiery wartościowe. O procedurach celnych, kiedy powinienem się tym niepokoić i kto powinien się tym za mnie zająć? W przypadku transportu na terenie UE zazwyczaj nie jest wymagana żadna specjalna dokumentacja, jednak gdy kraj pochodzenia lub przeznaczenia nie należy do Unii Europejskiej, klient zawsze musi przygotować dokumentację z wyprzedzeniem. W każdym kraju obowiązują inne zasady, dlatego możesz się z nami skonsultować, a my przeprowadzimy Cię przez ten proces. W niektórych przypadkach będziesz w stanie przygotować niezbędną dokumentację tylko z naszą pomocą, ale w większości przypadków to broker przeprowadzi ta praca. Jak zapakować towar do wysyłki? Dzięki dedykowanej dostawie vanem nie musisz pakować przesyłki w żaden konkretny sposób. Nadawca może umieścić towar w furgonetce w dowolny sposób, zapakowany lub nie. Należy jednak pamiętać, że podczas poruszania się furgonetki po autostradzie jeden przedmiot może zderzyć się z drugim, powodując szkody, a nikt nie chce, aby tak się stało, dlatego nadal zalecamy zabezpieczenie towaru na czas transportu, aby uniknąć uszkodzeń.

Will the driver always help to load/unload the load? No, please note that the driver\'s main focus is driving and he will help load and/or unload the cargo if this is contracted to at the time you hire the transport.

About custom procedures, when should I be concerned and who should take care of it for me? For transport within the EU, no special documentation is usually required, but when the country of origin or destination is not part of the European Union, the customer always needs to prepare the documentation in advance. Each country has different rules, so you can consult us and we will guide you through this process.In some cases you will be able to prepare the necessary documentation only with our help, but most of the time it is a broker that will carry out this work. How to pack the goods for shipping? With the dedicated van delivery, you do not need to package your shipment in any specific way. The shipper is able to accommodate the goods in the van however they like, packed or not. However, note that in the movement of the van on the highway one item can crash into the other causing damage and no one wants that to happen, so we still recommend protecting your goods for transport to avoid damage.', 'Często zadawane pytania Często zadawane pytania Czy wynajem vana obejmuje jakieś ubezpieczenie? Tak, każda przesyłka naszą dedykowaną dostawą vana objęta jest konwencjami CMR i dostępna jest również rozszerzona odpowiedzialność (w przypadku przesyłek komercyjnych). Wartość ta wynosi obecnie około 10 euro za kilogram i dotyczy wystąpienia kradzieży, uszkodzenia towaru, rażącego zaniedbania w transporcie międzynarodowym i krajowym.

Yes, every shipment with our dedicated van delivery is covered by CMR conventions and extended liability is also available (for commercial shipments). The value is currently around 10 euros per kilo and apply to occurrence of theft, damaged goods, gross negligence in international and domestic transport. Do you have only these two types of vans and measurements? No, we have other types, models and sizes of vans. The size you see in the description is an average, sizes may vary. We will always try to maintain the capacity contracted by you (13 and 19 cubic meters), so it is important that you provide us with as much information as possible about your cargo so that we can send you the appropriate van. To transport dangerous items we also have the ADR van and to transport perishable items that need controlled temperature, we have the refrigerated vans, which can be hired separately, just contact us via email or phone and we will provide you with a quote. Will the driver always help to load/unload the load? No, please note that the driver\'s main focus is driving and he will help load and/or unload the cargo if this is contracted to at the time you hire the transport. Please note that not all drivers are physically able to help, so you need to let us know in advance so that the ideal driver is chosen. How does the help service work? When you hire the help service, you need to consider that the driver will help to load/unload from the first floor level to the van and vice versa. For cases where loading/unloading is in apartments that do not have an elevator, you need to let us know in advance, as not all drivers are physically able to go up and down stairs. What can’t be shipped? Hazardous goods: e.g. firearms, explosives, ammunition, hazardous materials, radioactives. Illegal goods: Drugs, endangered species, other products illegal under EU laws. Livestock: Live stock animals, horses, pets, mice, worms, insects. Money: Currencies, banknotes and coins. Securities: Bonds, stocks, negotiable documents and all types of securities. About custom procedures, when should I be concerned and who should take care of it for me? For transport within the EU, no special documentation is usually required, but when the country of origin or destination is not part of the European Union, the customer always needs to prepare the documentation in advance. Each country has different rules, so you can consult us and we will guide you through this process.In some cases you will be able to prepare the necessary documentation only with our help, but most of the time it is a broker that will carry out this work. How to pack the goods for shipping? With the dedicated van delivery, you do not need to package your shipment in any specific way. The shipper is able to accommodate the goods in the van however they like, packed or not. However, note that in the movement of the van on the highway one item can crash into the other causing damage and no one wants that to happen, so we still recommend protecting your goods for transport to avoid damage.

Da, fiecare expediere cu livrarea noastră dedicată cu camioneta este acoperită de convențiile CMR și este disponibilă și răspundere extinsă (pentru transporturile comerciale). Valoarea este în prezent de aproximativ 10 euro pe kilogram și se aplică în cazul producerii de furturi, bunuri deteriorate, neglijență gravă în transportul internațional și intern. Aveți doar aceste două tipuri de dube și măsurători? Nu, avem alte tipuri, modele și dimensiuni de camionete. Mărimea pe care o vedeți în descriere este o medie, mărimile pot varia. Vom încerca întotdeauna să menținem capacitatea contractată de dumneavoastră (13 și 19 metri cubi), așa că este important să ne furnizați cât mai multe informații despre încărcătura dumneavoastră pentru a vă putea trimite duba corespunzătoare. Pentru transportul articolelor periculoase avem si duba ADR iar pentru transportul articolelor perisabile care au nevoie de temperatura controlata avem autoutilitare frigorifice, care se pot inchiria separat, doar sa ne contactati prin email sau telefonic si va vom oferi o oferta. Șoferul va ajuta întotdeauna la încărcarea/descărcarea încărcăturii? Nu, vă rugăm să rețineți că principalul obiectiv al șoferului este conducerea și el va ajuta la încărcarea și/sau descărcarea mărfii dacă acest lucru este contractat în momentul în care închiriați transportul. Vă rugăm să rețineți că nu toți șoferii sunt capabili fizic să vă ajute, așa că trebuie să ne anunțați în prealabil, astfel încât să fie ales șoferul ideal. Cum funcționează serviciul de ajutor? Atunci când angajați serviciul de ajutor, trebuie să aveți în vedere că șoferul vă va ajuta la încărcarea/descărcarea de la primul etaj până la dubă și invers. Pentru cazurile în care încărcarea/descărcarea se face în apartamente care nu au lift, trebuie să ne anunțați în prealabil, deoarece nu toți șoferii sunt capabili fizic să urce și să coboare scările. Ce nu poate fi expediat? Mărfuri periculoase: de exemplu arme de foc, explozivi, muniții, materiale periculoase, radioactive. Bunuri ilegale: Droguri, specii pe cale de dispariție, alte produse ilegale conform legislației UE. Animale: animale, cai, animale de companie, șoareci, viermi, insecte. Bani: monede, bancnote și monede. Valori mobiliare: Obligațiuni, acțiuni, documente negociabile și toate tipurile de titluri. Despre procedurile personalizate, când ar trebui să fiu îngrijorat și cine ar trebui să se ocupe de asta pentru mine? Pentru transportul în interiorul UE, de obicei nu este necesară nicio documentație specială, dar atunci când țara de origine sau de destinație nu face parte din Uniunea Europeană, clientul trebuie întotdeauna să pregătească documentația în avans. Fiecare țară are reguli diferite, așa că ne puteți consulta și vă vom îndruma prin acest proces. În unele cazuri veți putea pregăti documentația necesară doar cu ajutorul nostru, dar de cele mai multe ori este un broker care va efectua acest lucru. Cum se împachetează mărfurile pentru expediere? Cu livrarea cu camioneta dedicată, nu trebuie să împachetați transportul în vreun fel anume. Expeditorul poate găzdui mărfurile în camionetă oricum dorește, ambalate sau nu. Totuși, rețineți că în deplasarea autoutilitarei pe autostradă un articol se poate prăbuși în celălalt provocând daune și nimeni nu dorește să se întâmple asta, așa că vă recomandăm totuși să vă protejați bunurile pentru transport pentru a evita deteriorarea.

(1467, 'ro', 'Frequently Asked Questions Frequently Asked Questions Is there any insurance included when I hire the van service?

We will always try to maintain the capacity contracted by you (13 and 19 cubic meters), so it is important that you provide us with as much information as possible about your cargo so that we can send you the appropriate van. To transport dangerous items we also have the ADR van and to transport perishable items that need controlled temperature, we have the refrigerated vans, which can be hired separately, just contact us via email or phone and we will provide you with a quote. Will the driver always help to load/unload the load? No, please note that the driver\'s main focus is driving and he will help load and/or unload the cargo if this is contracted to at the time you hire the transport. Please note that not all drivers are physically able to help, so you need to let us know in advance so that the ideal driver is chosen. How does the help service work? When you hire the help service, you need to consider that the driver will help to load/unload from the first floor level to the van and vice versa. For cases where loading/unloading is in apartments that do not have an elevator, you need to let us know in advance, as not all drivers are physically able to go up and down stairs. What can’t be shipped? Hazardous goods: e.g. firearms, explosives, ammunition, hazardous materials, radioactives. Illegal goods: Drugs, endangered species, other products illegal under EU laws. Livestock: Live stock animals, horses, pets, mice, worms, insects. Money: Currencies, banknotes and coins. Securities: Bonds, stocks, negotiable documents and all types of securities. About custom procedures, when should I be concerned and who should take care of it for me? For transport within the EU, no special documentation is usually required, but when the country of origin or destination is not part of the European Union, the customer always needs to prepare the documentation in advance. Each country has different rules, so you can consult us and we will guide you through this process.In some cases you will be able to prepare the necessary documentation only with our help, but most of the time it is a broker that will carry out this work. How to pack the goods for shipping? With the dedicated van delivery, you do not need to package your shipment in any specific way. The shipper is able to accommodate the goods in the van however they like, packed or not. However, note that in the movement of the van on the highway one item can crash into the other causing damage and no one wants that to happen, so we still recommend protecting your goods for transport to avoid damage.', 'Întrebări frecvente Întrebări frecvente Există vreo asigurare inclusă atunci când angajez serviciul de furgonetă? Da, fiecare expediere cu livrarea noastră dedicată cu camioneta este acoperită de convențiile CMR și este disponibilă și răspundere extinsă (pentru transporturile comerciale). Valoarea este în prezent de aproximativ 10 euro pe kilogram și se aplică în cazul producerii de furturi, bunuri deteriorate, neglijență gravă în transportul internațional și intern. Aveți doar aceste două tipuri de dube și măsurători? Nu, avem alte tipuri, modele și dimensiuni de camionete. Mărimea pe care o vedeți în descriere este o medie, mărimile pot varia. Vom încerca întotdeauna să menținem capacitatea contractată de dumneavoastră (13 și 19 metri cubi), așa că este important să ne furnizați cât mai multe informații despre încărcătura dumneavoastră pentru a vă putea trimite duba corespunzătoare.

Șoferul va ajuta întotdeauna la încărcarea/descărcarea încărcăturii? Nu, vă rugăm să rețineți că principalul obiectiv al șoferului este conducerea și el va ajuta la încărcarea și/sau descărcarea mărfii dacă acest lucru este contractat în momentul în care închiriați transportul. Vă rugăm să rețineți că nu toți șoferii sunt capabili fizic să vă ajute, așa că trebuie să ne anunțați în prealabil, astfel încât să fie ales șoferul ideal. Cum funcționează serviciul de ajutor? Atunci când angajați serviciul de ajutor, trebuie să aveți în vedere că șoferul vă va ajuta la încărcarea/descărcarea de la primul etaj până la dubă și invers. Pentru cazurile în care încărcarea/descărcarea se face în apartamente care nu au lift, trebuie să ne anunțați în prealabil, deoarece nu toți șoferii sunt capabili fizic să urce și să coboare scările.

În unele cazuri veți putea pregăti documentația necesară doar cu ajutorul nostru, dar de cele mai multe ori este un broker care va efectua acest lucru. Cum se împachetează mărfurile pentru expediere? Cu livrarea cu camioneta dedicată, nu trebuie să împachetați transportul în vreun fel anume. Expeditorul poate găzdui mărfurile în camionetă oricum dorește, ambalate sau nu. Totuși, rețineți că în deplasarea autoutilitarei pe autostradă un articol se poate prăbuși în celălalt provocând daune și nimeni nu dorește să se întâmple asta, așa că vă recomandăm totuși să vă protejați bunurile pentru transport pentru a evita deteriorarea.', '2023-08-25 00:57:55', '2023-08-25 00:57:55'),
